## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the tenth week, I couldn't do much as I was preoccupied with multiple
class projects, so I was unable to work on it aside from going to small group
and discussing some of the connections between the backend and frontend group.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on pushing something that demonstrates some stuff I've learned
over the semester, even if it isn't completely functional.

## Anything Blocking?

The next week will still be pretty busy with classwork, but slightly less so
I will have more time this week.
