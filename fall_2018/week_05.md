## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the fifth week, I wrote code that created the databases that hold the
necessary components. I discussed the implementation with the other people doing
scheduling, and we reached a final version after some discussion.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan on writing the implementation that can load the data into the
database we created.

## Anything Blocking?

There is another group that is writing code to parse a file. Next week's code
for loading data into the database depends on the way that they parse that file,
so I will need to find out how they are representing their data before I can
work on this implementation.
