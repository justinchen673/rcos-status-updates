## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the fourth week, I came up with two different implementations of reading in
the data and enabling the shuttle tracker to display which time the shuttle is
next coming per stop.

## This Week's Plan

The two implementations are fundamentally different, so I'm planning on
discussing with my group about which implementation we should use. Once we
decide, we can start coding it The first implementation is relatively simple,
the second is quite a bit more complex.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing really for this week, aside from the fact that last week there was no
small meeting.
