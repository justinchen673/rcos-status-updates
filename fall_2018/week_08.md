## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the eighth week, I and some other members of the scheduling group contacted
the frontend group, as they are working on a full schedule display. We ironed
out some of the details regarding how our database works and how they can pull
their relevant information from the database.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan on linking the database to the frontend.

## Anything Blocking?

The Stop class has not yet been updated with the new schedule times, it is still
the old version of the Stop class which just contains the name and coordinates.

## Notes
