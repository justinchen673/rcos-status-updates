## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the ninth week, I found out early in the week that I needed to really
understand Go, as previously I believed that I could easily find out what was
going on since it was probably similar to other languages. I was wrong, so I
used tour.golang.org to go through a tutorial on Go. I also helped someone get
the shuttle tracker running on Ubuntu instead of Windows.

## This Week's Plan

This week I'll be pretty swamped with projects and exams, so I probably won't be
able to do much, but I'll continue looking at the Stop object and figuring out
how to integrate time into it so I can use it in Vue.

## Anything Blocking?

All of my classes have started ramping up recently, and it appears that it will
be that way until the end of the semester, so I'll be very limited on time for
the next couple of weeks. Most of my contributions have been through ideas and
learning about Vue, Git, Go, and PostgreSQL, so I'll probably just continue with
that for the next two weeks.
