## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the seventh week, I looked at the frontend in order to figure out how to
display the next couple times via popup. I found that the popup takes in a
single string, which we would need to edit to fit our schema.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan on editing the result of clicking on a stop. At the moment, it
just displays the stop name, but I'll write code that can, based on the time,
display the next couple of shuttle times.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
