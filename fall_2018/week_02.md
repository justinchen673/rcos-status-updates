## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the second week, I looked at the Go script that parses the Excel file as a
refernece for how to load it into the database.

## This Week's Plan

Our project has different features that groups of people will work on. I'm
working on the scheduling system, which should parse an excel file and be able
to display relevant information based on where on the map you click. I'll try
to familiarize myself with Go (the language) for the first week.

## Anything Blocking?

We don't exactly know how we're going to approach this, which we'll discuss at
next meeting, and since I didn't get any of their contact information (and I
don't know their names) I'm just going to do something independently first.

## Notes

A goal is to obtain all contact information and establish a group chat.
