## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the last week, I decided to write some documentation for the project in an
effort to show that I have learned something from this semester, and I also
pushed some code that I wrote earlier that should display the proper times upon
clicking on the leaflet nodes. It isn't completely functional since the backend
isn't complete but it should work given the structure of Stop is.

## This Week's Plan

This is finals week, so I'll most likely prioritize that.

## Anything Blocking?
