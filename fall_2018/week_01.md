## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the first week, I finally installed the shuttle tracker. The setup actually
took quite a while (decided to dual boot my laptop with Ubuntu in order to make
the setup easier), and after I set it up I helped others with the setup.

## This Week's Plan

Our project has different features that groups of people will work on. I'm
working on the scheduling system, which should parse an excel file and be able
to display relevant information based on where on the map you click. I'll try
to familiarize myself with Go (the language) for the first week.

## Anything Blocking?

We don't exactly know how we're going to approach this, which we'll discuss at
next meeting, and since I didn't get any of their contact information (and I
don't know their names) I'm just going to do something independently first.

## Notes

A goal is to obtain all contact information and establish a group chat.
