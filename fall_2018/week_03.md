## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the third week, I started learning how Vue.js and PostgreSQL work. I think
I now have a pretty good idea of how they work, as well as how the shuttle
tracker is structured.

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to try to write a script that can load the relevant data into the
database so that fetching it becomes easier.

## Anything Blocking?

We don't have the updated admin schedule, but we're trying to get our hands on
it. Our mentor said that he'll attend a meeting and hopefully get it then.
