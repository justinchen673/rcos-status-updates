## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the sixth week, I didn't do much because I was busy with an exam, but I did
play around with Vue and getting / parsing the current time with it.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan on looking into the frontend regarding how the popups are
currently displayed. I also plan on working on the presentation for next week.

## Anything Blocking?

A new pull request was sent out, and we spent quite a bit of time getting that
working with our local machine.
