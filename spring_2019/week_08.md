## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finished writing the placement of the first settlement. I figured out the 
weights by running a simulation of the inital phase thousands of times, exporting
the data to a CSV file and graphing it to see the distributions. I then took 
a hard value of the top 25% of data to be counted as "optimal" for each resource,
which is how the weights work.

## This Week's Plan

The second settlement is similar but still a bit different than the first, since it
must take into account the strategy that went into the first settlement. I plan on 
working on that, as well as what determines the placement of the roads.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
