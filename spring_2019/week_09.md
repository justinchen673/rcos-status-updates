## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week we had our group presentation, so we spent most of the week 
making and practicing the presentation and coming up with a script for the
demonstration.

## This Week's Plan

This week's plan is going to be last week's plan since I forgot about the 
presentation, which is creation of the method that places the second 
settlement based on the first one.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope, but I happen to be terrible at public speaking.

## Notes
