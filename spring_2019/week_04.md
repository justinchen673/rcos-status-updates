## Last Week's Accomplishments

I decided to go ahead and write the longest road algorithm myself, so the base 
game itself is finished now. I also decided to refactor all the code and document
it nicely since we've reached a checkpoint, and we are about to begin working on
the AI. We've already had a meeting where we discussed the implementation.

## This Week's Plan

This week we plan to work on the AI. Our group will actually be attending HackRPI,
and we plan to get a lot of it done in that time, which will be good for us since 
the AI is something we want to work on with all of us present as opposed to 
assigning jobs.

## Anything Blocking?

No, we feel pretty good about our progress and our plan.
