## Last Week's Accomplishments

I started developing the first stage of the game, which is the placement of the 
first settlements. I finished code that gathered all the necessary data and 
processed it, and began thinking about how I'm going to weigh that data in order
to make a decision.

## This Week's Plan

I need to come up with some values that the AI will respond to, such as:
"a probability higher than x indicates that this is superior to this spot 
even though there are better resources here", so basically just deciding how
the weights of each factors are determined. I'll do this by simulating the game
many many times and seeing how the probabilities stack up over time to determine
what constitutes as "good".

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
