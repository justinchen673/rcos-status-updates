## Last Week's Accomplishments

At HackRPI, we spend the time working on the AI. We did a lot of research and 
brainstormed much of how it would work. After quite a bit of time, we decided
to make a change in our approach to the project, so one of us is going to work
on an AI based around a neural network, while I'm going to work on AI that has
more of a preset strategy (or rather a preset couple of strategies).

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to do research on the AI, my goal is to make something that 
emulates my thinking process pretty well. I think the model that I'm planning
on emulating has 5 or so main strategies, which differs from the original AI
that will vary between practically 300 different win types.

## Anything Blocking?

Other than the semester starting to ramp up in general, not really.
