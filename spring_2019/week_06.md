## Last Week's Accomplishments

I researched the model and wrote a document describing the general way that the 
AI will think about the game. Next step is going to be a step by step model of
the thinking process.

## This Week's Plan

I'm next going to write how the flow of the AI works, which serves as 
pseudocode for me and that'll be what I base everything off of. I'll probably
work on the game based on the phase of the game it is in.

## Anything Blocking?

Same as last week, which is just class work in general ramping up.
