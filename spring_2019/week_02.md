## Last Week's Accomplishments

I continued working on the game aspect. I added 2 more things to last week's
to-do list, and this week I completed 2 of them (port implementation, largest
army calculation).

## This Week's Plan

There are 4 more tasks left on my to-do list until the game is completed. I
delegated the longest road task to Nicholas, and I'll finish the board 
randomization hex algorithm, the stealing functionality, and the requirement
of discarding half your cards at 7 or more.

## Anything Blocking?

As of now, nope
