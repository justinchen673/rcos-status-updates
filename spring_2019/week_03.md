## Last Week's Accomplishments

I continued working on the game aspect, and finished my goals from last week, so
the board randomization hex algorithm, the stealing functionality, and the 
requirement of discarding half your cards at 7 or more are all done. 

## This Week's Plan

The last requirement for the game to be fully functional is for the longest 
road calculation to be finished. I have some exams coming up in a couple of days 
and I delegated that task to someone else in our group, so if they have it done
by the time my exams are finished we'll all start working on the AI. If they 
don't finish it, I'll assist in that and probably start the AI next week.

## Anything Blocking?

We want to completely finish the game before starting coding the AI, so this 
algorithm needs to be coded in before anything else can happen.
