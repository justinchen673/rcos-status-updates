## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've been working on the game as a whole for the past couple weeks, but for
this most recent week I completed the implementation of development cards 
and I overhauled the structure of how victory points are tracked and calculated.

## This Week's Plan

There are 4 more tasks left on my to-do list until the game is completed. Two 
of them are relatively easy, but the other two require a bit more thought, so I 
can probably finish all 4 by next week. After that, we'll do some testing on 
the game and if everything works then we can start implementation of the AI.

## Anything Blocking?

Some of my work depends on other people completing their work, so I'm waiting
for that to be done.
